		<h1>Bugiver</h1>
		<p>
			Bugiver is a simple website that iterates through everyone that you are following and selects a random issue in a completely random
			repository in a language of your choice. I have designed it as my personal "I have nothing to do" button that gives me something
			to do in an attempt to encourage myself to contribute to more repositories than I create. Its source code, which you can find on
			<a href="/redirects/?t=github&d=bugiver">GitHub</a>, is published under the Apache 2.0 License.
